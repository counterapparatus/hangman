#Hangman 

This is a little hangman game I made as I learn ruby. I would love any feedback. 

##Open Questions and Future Changes
1. Am I using classes correctly? 
..**** really seems like I'm not, but it's unclear what I would have to do to fix this. 
2. The ASCII art array and the Dictionary both feel like they should go in a different file maybe
..* How do I call them if they are in a different file? 
3. I would love to impliment some way of adding to my dictionary
..*How do you make it so you can persist data or write to a file?
4. really far off but would love to make an AI that guesses based on frequency charts
